The script library_process.py can read a chemical library 
(commercial or internal) containing structures in SDF format.
It can convert structures into SMILES format, plot properties
like molecular weight, cLogP, TPSA, H-Bond donor, H-Bond acceptor,
and Number of rotatable bonds.  These properties are also written 
along with structures (SMILES) in a csv file so that Datawarrior 
program can be used to filter structures.  

In addition substructure search can be performed on a library using 
either a SMILES query or an SDF query.  Also chemical structures can 
be minimized and conformations can be generated.  For convenience
one can also create image file in PNG format of structures.  


Hope you may find it useful.
